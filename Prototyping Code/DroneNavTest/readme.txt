This file contains the implementation of the obstacle detection algorithm defined in the final report. Connect to an ESP32 and run through Arduino IDE and check the Serial Monitor to see how the drone will supposedly react upon detecting an obstacle.
Note that the sensor data is fake data as this is purely a simulation. This file is purely a test for how the drone should react and should be integrated with the sensor detection files properly to use real sensor data.
